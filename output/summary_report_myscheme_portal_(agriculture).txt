  "page_structure_challenges": "The MyScheme portal uses dynamic content loading, requiring scrolling to reveal all categories and schemes. Category and scheme card selectors need to be robust due to potential variations in HTML structure. Detail pages for schemes often use accordion-like structures for Eligibility and FAQs, which require specific handling (e.g., clicking to reveal content if not initially visible).",
  "anti_bot_mechanisms": "No explicit anti-bot mechanisms like CAPTCHAs or IP blocking were observed during testing. However, rapid requests might trigger rate limiting.",
  "data_completeness_evaluation": "Data completeness for schemes is generally good for title, link, and main content. Eligibility and FAQs are extracted where clearly identifiable, but their presence and exact formatting can vary between schemes, potentially leading to 'N/A' or incomplete FAQ lists for some entries. The 'content' field aims to capture all major text.",
